### Review Security Culture Part 2 (0:10)

Ask students to share their solutions to the previous exercise. In addition, discuss the sample solution below:

  - **Involve the Right People**: Training involves **HR**, **Security**, **Finance**, and **Communications**.

  - **Action Plan**:   
    - Schedule Quarterly Trainings
    - Design and Develop Training
    - Run Quarterly Training
    - Evaluate Impact After Each Training
    - Evaluate Overall Impact After One Year
  - **Schedule**: The Security and HR Teams decided that _quarterly_ training made the most sense.
  - **Metrics and KPIs**: The security team wants 0% of employees to allow tailgating after the training has run.
  - **Measurements**: One month after each quarter's training, security personnel will audit security cameras, and identity employees who allow others to tailgate. Those who have already been through training will be disciplined. Those who follow training guidelines will be rewarded. Those who have not yet been trained will be notified that they should stop, but will _not_ face disciplinary action.
