## Guided Practice: Security Culture Framework Part 1  (0:15)

### Instructions:

Welcome back! 

In this exercise, you'll play the role of a security consultant who's been contracted to help a local bank develop a plan to address a physical security issue that recently resulted in the breach of its financial data servers.

For context, refer to this memo from the executive team:

  - _Employees have been observed holding the door open for others behind them when accessing the building, without each employee scanning their own individual badges._  
  
    _The organization has determined that this behavior has led to several non-employees gaining unauthorized and undocumented access to several offices. With over 500 current employees, you can imagine how this might introduce serious issues._
  
    _Crucially, the Incident Response team recently identified that an attacker was able to steal confidential financial data from the servers in the Finance department. These machines are not connected to the Internet, so the breach must have resulted from physical access to the Finance machines._

  You'll develop a fully-fledged plan for addressing this problem throughout the day. To begin, you'll applying the first step of the Security Culture Framework: **Measuring and Setting Goals**.

  For this exercise, you'll need to:

  1. Explain the security risks this behavior introduces.

  2. Describe a method for finding out how many people encourage tailgating, and keeping track of those who do.

  3. Set a goal for how many employees _should_ engage in this behavior.

  4. Identify three potential "high level" solutions to this problem—e.g., via training, hiring guards, etc. Document one advantage and disadvantage for each.

  5. Set an estimated timeline for each potential solution.

  After this, you'll learn about common **Security Roles and Responsibilities**, then revisit the question of **Involving the Right People**.

  If you finish early, get ahead by considering the following questions:

  - All companies have leadership (CEO, etc.). Which common C-level officer titles do you know? Which do you think this company has?

  - Which security functions/responsibilities would any security department have?

  - Which teams would fulfill these responsibilities?

  Be sure to ask your instructors and TAs for help as necessary.

  **Good luck!**
