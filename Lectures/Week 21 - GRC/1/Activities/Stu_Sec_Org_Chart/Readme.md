## Guided Practice: Designing a Security Org Chart

### Instructions

In the last exercise, you began developing a plan for improving your client organization's security culture. Now that you understand how security departments are organized, you can decide who to involve in the execution of your plan.

Before you can do that, however, you need to know who works for the company in the first place. In this exercise, you'll answer that question by using a description of the client company to build out their organization chart.

You'll use this org chart in the next exercise to continue refining your security culture plan.

You can create an org chart by hand, but you can also use a free org chart creator online: [Formswift Organizational Chart](https://formswift.com/organizational-chart)
  
  - Select "Create My Document"
  
  - Click "Start Here" to create the first position, which is typically the CEO.
  
  - The org chart creator has several options when creating a position. While optional for this exercise, you can choose a specific color to align with the name of the individual that holds the position. Colors can be helpful to illustrate several types of roles. For example, senior leaders can all be red and department managers can all be green.
  
  - You can create more than one sub-role by selecting "Add" multiple times.
