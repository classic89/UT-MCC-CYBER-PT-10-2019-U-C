# Exercise — Threat Modeling, Step 5: Risk Analysis
Welcome back!

In this exercise, you’ll use the threats you identified previously to complete a quantitative risk assessment. You will fill out a spreadsheet containing all of the risks you can identify, and use it to generate a risk matrix and heat map for GeldCorp.

Find the instructions below. Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.

Good luck!

#### Instructions

- Open the provided spreadsheet (`RiskTemplate.xlsx`). Note the following tabs:
  - **Risk Assessment Data**: Contains descriptions of each risk, as well as probability and impact ratings.
  - **Risk Matrix**: Matrix displaying how many risks of each severity level you’ve identified.
  - **Heat Map**: A chart displaying whether you should make-do, monitor, manage, or mitigate each risk.
  - **Risk Ratings**: Information on GeldCorp’s risk rating guidelines.

- Use the threats you identified in the previous exercise to fill in the most critical risks you can think of. Fill out the risk description, probability, and impact cells for each risk.

- Next, consider less critical risks. Add at least five additional risks that are medium- or high-impact, but which are not very likely.
 
- When you have at least **ten** risks, click on the Risk Matrix tab. See at a glance how “at risk” GeldCorp is.

- Click on the Heat Map. Scroll down, and click the Update Chart Data and Labels button on the left. Answer the following questions:
  Which risks should you mitigate?
  Which risks should you manage?
  Which risks should you monitor?
  Do these results align with your expectations?
