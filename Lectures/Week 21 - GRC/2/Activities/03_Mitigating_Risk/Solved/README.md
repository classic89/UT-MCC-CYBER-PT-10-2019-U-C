## Instructions

Refer to the risk analysis you performed previously, and identify all of the risks you should monitor, manage, or mitigate.
- **XSS Injection Used to Hook Web-App Users' Browsers**
- **SQL Injection Used to Dump Database**
- **Engineer Downloads Backdoor Into Corporate Intranet**
- **Employee Steals Trading Algorithms from Technology Database**

- Suggest a security control for each risk. For each control, provide the following:  
- **XSS Injection Used to Hook Web-App Users' Browsers**
  - **Recommendation**: Use a framework to handle user input
  - **Type**: Technical 
  - **Intent**: Preventive 
  - **Time to Implementation**: One quarter
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Low (<$10k). Engineers must simply refactor existing code.
- **SQL Injection Used to Hook Web-App Users' Browsers**
  - **Recommendation**: Use a framework to handle user input
  - **Type**: Technical

  - **Recommendation**: Install antivirus over whole Enterprise domain
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Intent**: Preventive
  - **Time to Implementation**: Very fast
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Very Low (<$10). Cost is mostly due to licensing the software.
- **Engineer Steals Trading Algorithms from Technology Database**
  - **Recommendation**: Restrict access to databases containing confidential information.
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Intent**: Preventive
  - **Time to Implementation**: Very fast
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Very Low (<$10). Cost is mostly due to licensing the software.

Finally, rank these issues from least to most important, taking into consideration how much each solution costs.
