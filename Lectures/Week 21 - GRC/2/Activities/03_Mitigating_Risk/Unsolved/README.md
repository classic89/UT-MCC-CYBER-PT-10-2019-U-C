# Exercise — Mitigating Risks

Welcome back!

In this exercise, you’ll use the analysis from the previous exercise to advise GeldCorp as to how to address the risks you identified. 

You will identify any risks the analysis suggested you monitor, manage, or mitigate. Then, you’ll estimate how much your mitigation strategy would cost, and how long it will take to implement.

Finally, you’ll make a recommendation as to which mitigation strategies GeldCorp should prioritize, based on your risk analysis and the cost of implementing a fix.

Find the instructions below. Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.

Good luck!

## Instructions

- Refer to the risk analysis you performed previously, and identify all of the risks you should monitor, manage, or mitigate.

- Suggest a security control for each risk. For each control, provide the following:  
  - **Description**: One-or-two sentence description of what the control does
  - **Type**: Is this a physical, administrative, or technical control?
  - **Intent**: Is this a corrective, preventive, detective, deterrent, or … control?
  - **Method of Action**: How does this control lower risk/prevent attacks?
Time to Implementation: How long will it take to implement?

- After drafting your mitigation strategies, refer to the results of your earlier quantitative risk analysis. Rank your suggested strategies based on how much they cost, relative to the potential impact of each risk.

Finally, identify three security controls that GeldCorp should begin implementing immediately, and explain why each is so important.
