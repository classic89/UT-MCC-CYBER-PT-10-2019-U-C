In this exercise, you will help them realize these goals by developing and documenting policies to support them.

The objectives are documented below. Please fill out the provided template when documenting your policies.

#### Internal Goals
- Eliminate tailgating at all main offices.
  - **Note**: _Tailgating_ is when an employee holds the door open for others, thus allowing them to enter the building without scanning their ID.

- Guarantee 99% uptime for all trading applications.

- Reduce incidence of developers accessing customer PII that they don't need for their projects.
